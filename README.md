# IMG_PROC_UDEMY

This repository contains some codes I wrote from a guided course in Python Digital Image Processing.
You can find the course through this link: https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-image-processing-from-ground-up-in-python/
While I watched the guided codes, I made some changes by myself to test new libraries/possibilities. 
You can use these tools as basic image processing tools in your Python works.

IMPORTANT: While opening images with Image from PIL, be sure you changed the PATH. 
For example: img = Image.open('C:/Users/Misab/Desktop/Image processing/data/profile.jpg')
You must change 'C:/Users/Misab/Desktop/Image processing/data/FILE' for your specific PATH.

Hope you like it =D
